## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- SCSS styles
- Mobile-first workflow


### Useful resources

- [SCSS docs](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/) - This helped me in developing and understanding the conscepts of scss. I am going to use scss from now on wherever I can because SCSS is so good.
- [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/) - I use this whenever I find any doubt in my CSS and found some problem in my code.
